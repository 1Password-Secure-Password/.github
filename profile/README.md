## What is 1Password?

**1Password** is a premium password manager designed to store, organize, and protect sensitive information across all your devices. Built with a strong focus on privacy and modern encryption, 1Password securely manages passwords, credit cards, secure notes, recovery keys, documents, and online identities.

Using a **zero-knowledge security model**, 1Password ensures that only you can access your data. The platform never stores or transmits your master password, making brute-force and server-side attacks ineffective. Additional protection comes from a unique **Secret Key**, which adds a second cryptographic layer on top of industry-standard 256-bit encryption.

1Password supports families, teams, and enterprises with secure sharing, access control, activity logs, breach monitoring, and policies. It is trusted by millions of users and leading companies to manage credentials, automate sign-ins, and enforce security hygiene.
